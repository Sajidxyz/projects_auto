    "description": "Do you remember this guy? He’s the strongest baseball pitcher in all of Korea, but that incredible strength kinda turned into a curse. His throws were faster than cars, and not just fast; they were unbelievably accurate too. The only problem? Nobody really wanted to play with him anymore. So he came up with a genius plan. He started using lighter stuff, like onions, so his friends could actually keep up with him. And if that was still too much for them, he’d switch to something tiny like a bottle cap and somehow still throw a perfect pitch.",
